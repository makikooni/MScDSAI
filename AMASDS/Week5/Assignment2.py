    ## Data

    We measured retrospective time estimation (RTE). The participants were not informed that they would later be asked to estimate the duration of play to assess the remembered duration. After the game, we asked participants to estimate the duration of play.

    Participants were asked to choose one of eleven RTE intervals, starting from 61–90 seconds and ending with 361–390 seconds. With 272 seconds as the correct duration of the game, the eighth interval was the right choice. However, the seventh interval was also accepted as correct for the subsequent analysis because it was so close.

    Additionally, the researchers defined the relaxed absolute difference (RAD) as a metric for how close participants’ RTE was to the correct answer. An absolute measure was chosen as otherwise over vs. underestimations would skew each other, and we were interested in correct vs. incorrect time estimation. The measure was relaxed in the sense that both intervals 7 and 8 counted as correct (i.e., RAD = 0), intervals 6 and 9 both counted as RAD = 1, etc.

    1. The analyses were conducted using non-parametric tests because the research question — *How does the presence of music affect time perception in a VR game?* — involves ordinal data that are not normally distributed, and population parameters could not be reliably estimated. Given that there are two independent groups (with-music vs. without-music), the **Mann–Whitney U test** was chosen to compare participants’ responses between conditions.
    2. **H₀**: Music has no effect on time perception in VR games.<br>
       **H₁**: Music affects time perception in VR games. <br>
       **IV**; Condition: Music vs No Music <br>
       **DV**; Time perception	Measured via RTE (Retrospective Time Estimation) and RAD (Relaxed Absolute Difference).
    3. The p-values for both RTE and RAD were below 0.05 (RTE: p = 0.038; RAD: p = 0.008), indicating that the differences between the music and no-music conditions were statistically **significant**. 
    4. Based on the results, **H₀ is rejected** for both measures.
    5. Conclusion: The findings suggest that background music significantly influences time perception in VR games. Participants’ estimated durations (RTE) and their accuracy (RAD) differed between the music and no-music conditions, supporting the hypothesis that presence of music affects perceived time.
