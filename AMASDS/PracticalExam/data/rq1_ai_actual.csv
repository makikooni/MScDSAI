After two weeks of pushing deeper into the jungle, he stumbled upon a settlement of mudhuts, where he saw  groups of native women, some cooking food over fires, some sitting by the river washing clothes, as they watched their children playing happily in the distance.

It became clear that the child had been seen running towards the undergrowth, but when John ventured in that direction, the women tried to stop him, looks of sheer terror on their faces, and emitting bloodcurdling screams as he ignored their warnings and ran towards the deep undergrowth.  As he ventured further, the jungle became thicker, and after two hours of struggling through the dense growth, sustaining cuts and bruises and being bitten by insects, he stumbled, falling and hitting his head on a stump, whereupon he passed out.  As he regained consciousness, he remembered a vivid dream that he must have experienced whilst unconscious, where he was floundering in a swamp, desperately trying to get out, before succumbing to the abyss; when suddenly a small boy appeared from nowhere and miraculously pulled him to safety, after which, John knew he had to carry on and find the missing boy.  He got to his feet and staggered on, gradually becoming stronger, when suddenly a clearing appeared in the jungle, and John could hardly believe what he was witnessing: the long lost city he had set out to discover, and here was the missing boy, looking bewildered and lost; John hauled him up onto his shoulders and began the long journey back to the safety of the boy's home village.

I'd booked and embarked a fairly bog standard 2 week sailing holiday touring the Greek Islands during the summer months last year. There was myself and 5 other guests on the boat together with the captain and two other crew members responsible for the day to day running of the boat and keeping their paying passengers happy. All was proceeding as planned and we'd already enjoyed some leisurely sailing initially setting sail from Athens and touring the Greek mainland coast two days and two nights before heading into more adventurous waters. The plan was to head toward Santorini and we were well on our way until the fourth night of the trip where we encountered the most amazing an colourful storm the like of which I have never seen before. As we were engulfed by the storm the boat was lifted out of the water and we found ourselves bashed and buffeted towards an island which worryingly the captain informed us did not appear on any maps and to make matters worse the storm had made out boat no longer seaworthy and knocked out all of our communications and navigation equipment. We set up camp on the island as best we could with what we could extract from our damaged boat but what was even stranger we were not alone on the island - it would appear that we were sharing the island with a colony of 6 foot tall chickens.

Max and Sarden had been sent to Tarris with, food supplies and a team of andriods to secure the main tourist facility and rescue any survivors after it had been breached by the nocturnal beasts. The arrival on Tarris was not uneventful, with the space pod being tossed around by freak atmospheric storms resulting in its landing outside the tourist compound, some 20 clicks away, and night closing in fast.  Max and Sarden were fearful for their chances, but set up the android soldiers around the pod to watch and protect throughout the long night; even so neither got much sleep, with the howling of the beasts and the gradual disappearance of the droids, one by one until there were none left, just themselves.  They could hear something scratching at the metal work of the pod; it sounded like metal claws and very heavy breathing, as it managed to prise open the door.  Crouched in the corner, Max and Sarden could see the red eyes of the beast approaching them, drool dripping to the floor from its sharp teeth; but then suddenly it stopped, sniffed the air, its features softened and it looked enquiringly at Max and Sarden.  Sarden held out his protein food bar to the beast, who after 5 minutes of hesitation took it out of his hand, licked his outstretched hand, requesting more. Fortunately, they had a large supply of food and they realised that starvation was driving the beasts to attack the compound, and with more supplies being regularly sent, the beasts and the tourists could coexist in harmony.

From the gas clouds, crystalline rain, down to the plants and even the soil, it was like Sarah was a newborn exploring how the world worked with no frame of reference. Luckily, the creatures that inhabited the planet were not either incredibly hostile nor completely afraid as was the norm on planetary excursions, and she was able to live a peaceful coexistence with them. Over some time, this coexistence became a friendship, and an understanding of their communication through much trial and error meant that Sarah was able to become a part of their society. This society then revealed their most pressing need; the recovery of their ancient orb which had been lost in tribal warfare many centuries ago, that was crucial for the true succession of a ruler to unify their people.
